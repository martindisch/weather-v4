# weather-v3

This is the fourth iteration of my simple weather station using an AM2302
sensor, this time with a Leptos web app.

The system has two parts:

- [Base station](weather-station/README.md) with sensor, taking regular
  measurements and uploading them to the backend whenever it has connectivity
- [Backend and client](weather-app/README.md) for storing and interacting with
  current and historical readings
